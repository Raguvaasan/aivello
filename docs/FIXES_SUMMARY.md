- ✅ Added error boundaries for better error handling

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading for all tool components
- ✅ Removed TensorFlow.js dependencies (major bundle size reduction)
- ✅ Added React.memo for Header component
- ✅ Added service worker for PWA functionality
- ✅ Enhanced error boundaries

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness

## Remaining Bundle Size Issues

The main bundle is still 598KB due to:
1. **PDF libraries** (pdf-lib, pdfjs-dist, jspdf) - ~200KB
2. **Firebase SDK** - ~150KB  
3. **React Router DOM v7** - ~50KB
4. **Framer Motion** - ~40KB
5. **Multiple icon libraries and tools** - ~100KB

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Dynamic PDF Loading**: Load PDF libraries only when PDF tools are used
2. **Firebase Tree Shaking**: Import only needed Firebase modules
3. **Icon Optimization**: Use selective icon imports instead of entire libraries

### Future Optimizations:
1. **Service Worker Caching**: Cache static assets aggressively
2. **Image Optimization**: Add WebP support and image compression
3. **Critical CSS**: Extract above-the-fold CSS
4. **Preconnect**: Add more preconnect hints for external resources
